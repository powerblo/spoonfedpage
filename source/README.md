## Spoonfed
Spoonfed is an Obsidian Zettelkasten for teaching/studying maths.

It contains short expository articles (primers) for first time studying, notes linking to material/external resources in a wiki style, and problems (psets) for quick testing/further studying.

Each material is composed of a single page divided into chapters.

Currently ongoing projects : 
- [[1-linalg|Linear Algebra]]

It's best to treat the series as supplementary material to a textbook/lecture to accompany you on your journey; some extra reading to ease the effort of working through a course. While effort has been put into provide enough material in an accessible manner, much of the material isn't really structured for a linear reading; it's closer to a wiki/FAQ than a real textbook. Nothing can replace taking a textbook and working through its material and exercises!

This series was written with Obsidian with the following plugins;
- [dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)
- [obsidian-annotator](https://github.com/elias-sundqvist/obsidian-annotator)
- [obsidian-hypothesis](https://github.com/weichenw/obsidian-hypothesis-plugin)

and certain features like viewing material directly from pdfs might not work as intended without Obsidian or the plugins above.

### PSETS
TF problems prompt a true/false response; SNEU problems prompt the logical relation between two statements presented as A:B, either sufficient (A implies B), necessary (A is implied by B), equivalent or unrelated.
The solutions will present the answer for each problem in three "steps"; the short answer, justification in a short summary/outline of a proof, and proper proof.

Additional problems and further reading material covers applications and advanced material.
